      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <article>
        For many years, Bethany has been baking the most delicious pies at her
        home. In 2013, we opened our first store in Brussels (Belgium) in a cosy
        little street near the Grand Market. People from all over the world fell
        in love with the soft cakes, heavenly cheese cakes, spicy apple pies...
        The store became a success in no time. In 2015, no less than 100 pies
        were sold every day and Bethany's Pie Shop moved into a larger building.
        After receiving many requests, it became clear that our next step was
        making it possible to order pies from the comfort of your own home and
        from anywhere in the world. You are now looking at the result of this:
        our very own webstore, making it possible to order Bethany's delicious
        pies whenever you feel like it!
